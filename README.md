# Exercise-3

The exercise for this week is meant to help you to understand `for` loops and conditional statements in Python.
Below you have a series of problems in which you are asked to edit the notebook files and write the code necessary to produce the desired results.

- Don't forget to check out the [hints for this week's exercise](https://geo-python.github.io/site/lessons/L3/exercise-3.html) if you're having trouble.

- Scores on this exercise are out of **20 points** based on solving all 3 problems. Problem 4 is optional.

## Before you start

### Check that your IPython is up-to-date

Our automatic grading system requires to have IPython version which is higher than 3. Test your version by running following lines of code in JupyterLab:

```python

import IPython
assert IPython.version_info[0] >= 3, "Your version of IPython is too old, please update it. Ask help, if you don't know how."
print("Your system is okay, you can continue! :) ")

```

### Clone the Exercise 3 repository

Before starting to work with the actual problems for this week, you should start a new JupyterLab instance and clone your own Exercise 3 repository (e.g. exercise-3-htenkanen) into the instance using Git as we saw in the [**lecture**](https://geo-python.github.io/site/lessons/L2/git-basics.html#clone-a-repository-from-github) during week 2.
